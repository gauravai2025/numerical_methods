This repository contains implementations of several numerical methods commonly used in scientific computing. These methods have been implemented in Matlab and are organized into several folder based on the type of problem they are designed to solve.

The following numerical methods are currently included in this repository:

Root finding methods:

Bisection method
<br>
Newton's raphson  method
<br>
