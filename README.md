This repository contains implementations of several numerical methods commonly used in scientific computing. These methods have been implemented in Matlab and are organized into several folder based on the type of problem they are designed to solve.

The following numerical methods are currently included in this repository:

Root finding methods:

Bisection method
<br>
Newton's raphson  method
<br>

Ordinary differential equation (ODE) solvers:

Euler's method
<br>
Runge-Kutta methods (2nd and 4th order)

Each folder  contains a separate MATLAB script or function with the same name as the numerical method it implements.

To use the code in this repository, simply download or clone the repository to your local machine and run the desired script or function in MATLAB. Each script or function can be run by calling its name in the MATLAB command window.
